## My Kindred Spirit

### Meet Reese

My project is for my kitten, Reese. He’s super playful and curious, but he also gets stressed really easily, (at the vet, moving house, going outside). One thing I’ve noticed is that bright colours, moving shapes, and water distract him, so I wanted to create something just for him that utilises these.

Reese and I have a strong bond. I adopted him when he was 2 months old, and though I have help from my roommates, I am his mum. As he is a kitten, he has a lot of energy and requires significant attention and stimulation. I’ve learned to read his moods, when he's hungry, happy, tired, etc. As he's gotten older, I've noticed he gets anxious in new environments, I want to help him feel safe and relaxed.

The main goal of this project is to give Reese something soothing to focus on when he’s feeling stressed. It’s like a little visual toy made just for him, full of bright colours and stimulations, like a digital cat TV. It has an interactive user element so I can play with him to, just like I would with his other toys.

Stress is the big enemy here, especially in unfamiliar places whenever he has to leave his comfort zone. Loud noises, weird smells, and strange people freak Reese out a little, and though I try, I can’t exactly explain to him what’s going on. This project is my way of helping him feel a little more comfortable in those moments, distracting him.

### How can Reese relate/interact with my project?

Since Reese is a kitten, he experiences the world differently from me. His attention is drawn to movement, bright colours, and sounds that spark curiosity in order to comfort. I'll design my project with this in mind, making sure it’s something he can actively engage with and enjoy.

Reese is naturally drawn to bright, high-contrast colours and smooth, flowing motion, just like many cats who love watching screens. I’ll used bold, shifting colours and dynamic shapes that change in response to movement, creating something visually stimulating for him. I'll use a grid system in my project ensures constant variation, keeping it engaging so he doesn’t lose interest.

While I haven’t focused much on sound yet, I think I'll use water noises as Reese has shown interest and curiousity in water a lot recently. Reese tends to react to light, delicate sounds more than loud or sudden ones, so any audio I include would be designed to be gentle and non-intrusive.

Although Reese can’t control the program like a human would be able to, he can interact with it in his own way. He often paws at moving shapes on my laptop screen anyway, so my project’s movement-based colour changes might keep his attention.

Of course, Reese won't understand my project in the way a person would—he doesn’t know that it was made for him. But in his world, it’s a shifting, playful display that reacts in ways that grab his attention and (hopefully) calm him down or simply distract him. In that sense, it serves its purpose as an offering to my kindred spirit.
