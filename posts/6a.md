# Signals & three.js (cont.)

## Libraries

q5.js
This one is like p5.js but it’s built around "signals," which are values that change over time. It’s really good for animations that respond smoothly to input or internal changes. Think of it as p5’s chill, mathy cousin who’s always tweaking stuff with smooth transitions.

c2.js
This is all about envelopes and automation—basically, it lets you control how a value evolves over time using curves or patterns. People use it for procedural animation, generative visuals, or even sound synthesis stuff. It feels kinda like a modular synth, but for data.

svg.js
A library for working with SVG (scalable vector graphics). It makes it super easy to create and animate SVG shapes with JavaScript. Great if you want sharp, resolution-independent graphics or cleaner DOM integration, instead of using canvas.

Key differences
q5.js and c2.js both deal with smooth, time-based changes, but q5 focuses on reactive signals and chaining, while c2 is more about explicitly setting envelopes and shaping them. svg.js is totally different: it's for drawing and manipulating SVG elements in the browser. The other two are more about data and animation logic.

You can't always use these libraries in a JavaScript module right away, at least not unless they're properly exported as ES modules. Some of them were built before ES modules became the dtandard, so you’ll need to take a few extra steps. One option is to use a bundler like Vite or Parcel to package them.

esm.sh is super handy when a library doesn’t support ES module imports out of the box. It’s especially useful in environments like Deno, where everything needs to be imported as a module. esm.sh lets you grab npm packages and use them as module, ready URLs, perfect for modern workflows that want to skip bundling tools altogether.

## Text summeries

"Information & Thinking" – Michel Serres
Serres talks about how thinking isn't just in the brain. It’s distributed—in our tools, our environment, even in the layout of a keyboard. He says information isn't passive; it's something we interact with, shape, and carry with us. Knowledge flows through systems and symbols, not just through logic.

"What Is It Like to Be a Fungus?" – Merlin Sheldrake
Sheldrake explores how fungi challenge our idea of individuality and consciousness. Fungi don’t have a brain, but they behave in complex, responsive ways. They're networks—branching, feeling, learning through growth. The piece makes us question if thinking has to look human to be real. It’s weird, alive, and totally different.

"Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation" – Laboria Cuboniks
This manifesto argues that technology, gender, and nature should be hacked. Xenofeminism wants to use alienation as a tool to break oppressive systems, rather than romanticising "natural" ways of being. It’s radical, futuristic, and believes in techno-political transformation—not escaping tech, but reprogramming it to be more inclusive and liberating.
