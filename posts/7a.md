# Web Audio API & Responding to Text

## Sound in Assignment 2

To make my sound design function in a chaotic aesthetic register, I'll explore how sound moves between structured clarity and unpredictable noise. Chaotic sound isn't just loud or random, it hovers on the edge of comprehension, balancing pattern and disruption. This relates to Philip Galanter's concept of effective complexity, which says something is complex when it lies between total order and complete randomness.

Structure is how we recognise patterns: through rhythm, harmony, repetition, and contrast. I’ll start with clear, steady pulses or tonal centres, then use envelopes, filters, and randomness to pull them apart over time. I’m interested in how something like a filtered noise burst can begin as organised sound and shift into something much more unpredictable. I’ll also push sound across the stereo field so that things feel like they’re moving,sometimes drifting, sometimes jolting across space.

Noise steps in as the enemy of structure, or maybe its hidden partner. White and pink noise will be my raw material. I’ll modulate its amplitude and filter settings to build textures that almost sound like real instruments or melodies but dissolve before they lock in. Musical fragments might rise up from the chaos and then fall back into the storm, teasing familiarity.

Voice complicates it all. It’s so human, so loaded with meaning, and that makes it powerful. I’ll take vocal samples and completely twist them, stretch them out, reverse them, granulate them, so they become less “speech” and more like alien signal. This is about defamiliarisation, like Loveless talks about, taking something we know and making it strange again. A robotic loop of a human voice can be unsettling and poetic all at once.

Bringing all three together lets me make a soundscape that walks the line between order and chaos

## Examples

Pink Trombone
This tool shows how chaotic the human voice can be when untrained or manipulated. I could mimic its instability and variability using real-time pitch shifting. (MouseX or MouseY gradient)

MyNoise: Thunder
Nature sounds often embody chaotic registers (non-looping, layered, dynamically shaped). I could record thunder-like textures with multiple oscillators detuned and spatialised, edit using Reaper.

How to Kill a Zombie
Its theatrical use of sound shows how emotional energy lives in over the top layering. I can take this as a cue to make intense sonic "drops" in the middle of otherwise quiet scenes.
