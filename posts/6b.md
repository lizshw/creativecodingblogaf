# Shaders, Moiré, & the Demoscene

## Assignment 2 rough draft

Text Choice: What Is It Like to Be a Fungus? by Merlin Sheldrake
This is the text I’ve decided to respond to for my a2 project. I really connected with its weird, wandering, decentralised logic and the way it challenges human-centred thinking.

Three Passages That Stood Out to Me:
“Fungi are not singular individuals, but dynamic, networked beings…”

- This influenced my idea to use recursion and networks in the design.

“They explore the world by growing into it…”

- I want the movement of shapes or data to feel like a kind of organic expansion.

“We understand ourselves best when we step outside ourselves.”

- I’m trying to make the user feel alien or peripheral in the sketch rather than central.

### Assignment planning

I’m building an interactive sketch where recursive spores branch off when they hit boundaries (already working). I’ll now overlay a shader effect across the background to add ambient visual noise, glitch-like distortion, or subtle organic pulses. The idea is for everything to feel alive and slightly unstable.

I’ll keep the network drawing lines between spores because that already feels like it’s simulating mycelial complexity. The shader will layer an atmospheric chaos on top, pushing the aesthetic further.

I’ll show this rough draft to three peers and ask them:

- Does this feel like a thoughtful response to Sheldrake’s text?

- Does it feel like a post-digital work (hybrid, reflexive, messy)?

- Does the composition sit within a chaotic register, and if so, is it still legible?
