# Cute as Aesthetic Register

## What is _Cute_

_Cute_ as an aesthetic register refers to the visual and otherwise emotional style that leans into innocense and playfulness, evoking the affection and protective instincts of the viewer. It uses extermities, such as expressive facial features (big eyes and or movements), round shapes, bright or pastel colour pallettes, small or chubby proportions, shy and timidness, happy and energetic behaviour.

_Cute_ things often appear small, weak, or innocent, but that very appearance gives them a unique kind of influence. Cuteness can trigger a biological protective response which can than be used to manipulate emotions. An example of this given in class was a cat. While humans own cats, when you assess the relationship, specifically the power balance, you can see that the cat holds all the power, dispite being the seemingly submissive one in the relationship. People are more likely to be gentle, patient, or generous toward something _cute_. This gives _cute_ things an advantage in social interactions. _Cute_ things often use soft power (persuasion, charm, emotional influence) rather than hard power (force, dominance).

The relationship between _cute_ and commodification is deeply intertwinedâ€”cuteness makes things more marketable, while commodification shapes how cuteness is produced, packaged, and sold. _Cute_ characters (Hello Kitty, Mickey Mouse, or Pikachu) generate billions through toys, apparel, and accessories.These products often tap into childhood nostalgia, insighting adults buy things that remind them of their childhood.

| clouds               | high pitches    |                            |

### Idea Plan

The idea for my project will be for my cat Reese. I will make him a screen that actively moves and changes. While he can't physically move the mouse, Reese will be able to paw at the screen and follow movements with his eyes. While I want it to be cute first and formost, I also want it to be chaotic, like Reese. I want to create a grid of squares that change colour when you hover over them. When you click it will get smaller and smaller, changing colour each time. I'll add waater noises as you move the curser through the grid to replicate the feeling of running your hand through water. Additionally, I will had particles that will fly across the screen on their own, multiplying the more you click, representing fireflies.
