## Zany, Cute, Interesting

I think when McKenzie Wark says “the zany really works against its constraints,” she’s pointing out how zaniness is all about energy that pushes back,like it doesn’t sit neatly inside a system. The “interesting” might play along with rules or critique them intellectually, but the “zany” goes wild within them, often exhausting itself in the process. It’s performative and erratic and kind of chaotic in how it refuses to settle.

That makes the zany and the chaotic feel pretty similar in some ways. They both have this unstable energy,things jumping around, changing constantly, too much happening at once. But they’re different in how they land emotionally. Chaos feels bigger, maybe even scary or sublime, while zaniness is more human and silly,it’s chaos with a grin. Zany is still chaotic, but it has personality, a sense of play.

I think my assignment 2 is zany (at least so far). The bouncing balls already have a kind of unpredictable, reactive energy. They don’t just move, they hit the wall, rebound, and cluster in ways that are lively and animated. Especially with how they are intended to resemble fungi, there’s something organic and theatrical about it. It’s not just simulation, it’s a over the top.

How to Make It More Zany

- Add strange, mismatched sound effects for each bounce, maybe squeaks, pops, or absurd vocalisations.

- Exaggerate the visuals (make the balls stretch and squash like cartoons or leave trails behind)

- Create a sense of manic energy by increasing the pace unpredictably or layering effects that visually “overwhelm” the screen.

- Introduce elements that feel like they’re trying too hard, extra bouncing, growing, or duplicating when they shouldn’t.

## My Assignment 2

My sketch is inspired by Merlin Sheldrake’s exploration of fungal life as a relational, decentralised, and entangled system. In his writing, fungi are presented not as isolated organisms but as networks of becoming, constantly branching, decaying, and reorganising. My sketch translates these ideas into interactive form: spores bounce off the environment, reproduce through branching, and gradually fade away. The connecting lines visualise mycelial entanglement, making visible the relationships that structure fungal life.

It reflects Sheldrake’s emphasis on non-linearity and co-dependence. Spores only multiply when they collide with walls, a kind of environmental constraint triggering change. Their lifespan suggests decay and impermanence, while their interconnection hints at a larger, emergent system where each part influences the whole. This is not just simulation, it’s a speculative gesture that makes fungal life perceptible through interaction, form, and feedback.

This work is post-digital because it embraces complexity, decay, and interaction over polished control. Rather than hiding its digital nature, it reveals the code’s logic through generative branching, fading spores, and recursive structures. The viewer’s input becomes part of an unpredictable system, where organic behaviours emerge from algorithmic rules. By blending natural metaphors (fungi, networks, decay) with computational aesthetics, it reflects a post-digital sensibility that sees technology not as separate from life, but entangled with it.

Variables

- spores, maxSpores, speedFactor, lifespan, vx, vy, etc., store values that change over time.

Iteration

- for loops in draw() and within the mycelial connection code iterate through spores to update, display, and draw connections.

Functions

- setup(), draw(), update(), display(), and branch() organise behaviour into reusable blocks of logic.

Boolean Logic

- if statements check for wall collisions (if (this.x < 0) etc.), lifespan expiration, and distance thresholds (if (d < 100)).

Arrays

- The spores array stores all spore objects and is dynamically updated (with push() and splice()).

Classes

- The Spore class defines the properties and behaviours of each spore, encapsulating them as objects.

Recursion

- Each spore can spawn another smaller spore when bouncing, creating a recursive branching system.
